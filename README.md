## Reproducible Neovim Setup with Nix

This flake contains all information for my Neovim configuration.  
With this repository in place I can enter my Neovim aka Dev environment on every machine simply by running...  
```console
nix run github:maff9n/neovim_flake
```

## Current Status
This project is actively under development.  
Proof of Concept successful.  
Once I fill this repository up with my personal tweaks, it will be ready for my everyday use.

## Credit

The configuration heavily draws inspiration from this [article](https://primamateria.github.io/blog/neovim-nix/).
