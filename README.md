This flake contains all information for my Neovim configuration.  
With this repository in place I can enter my Neovim aka developer environment on every machine simply by running...  
```console
nix run github:maff9n/neovim_flake
```

## Current Status
This project is actively under development.  
Proof of Concept successful.

## Credit
