This flake contains all information for my Neovim configuration.  
With this repository in place, I can launch my IDE (Neovim) on any machine simply by running:
```console
nix run github:maff9n/neovim_flake
```

## Current Status
This project is actively under development.  

## Credit

The configuration is heavily inspired by this [article](https://primamateria.github.io/blog/neovim-nix/).  
Additional ideas were deprived from [this project](https://github.com/figsoda/cfg).
